# Demographic-Segmentation


Demographic segmentation is market segmentation according to age, race, religion, gender, family size, ethnicity, income, and education. Demographics can be segmented into several markets to help an organization target its consumers more accurately. With this type of segmentation, an organization can categorize the needs of consumers

# Advantages of Demographic Segmentation

One of the main advantages of demographic segmentation is that the information you need is readily available for you. You can pull census data to determine who, where, and how you want to market your product. For example, automobile industries can market their cars to different age groups, income levels, and genders.

Another way that businesses, such as automobile industries, don't miss out on the growing market is by providing employees who are bilingual to work with their customers. It is now very common to see business, TV, and newspapers in Spanish as well as English.

Another advantage of demographic segmentation is customer retention and loyalty. When an organization spends time focusing on its customers and their wants and needs, customers will typically come back for repeat business. In our automobile industry example, customers will come back or recommend their friends and family if they were satisfied with their purchase.

# Artificial Neural Network
Artificial neural networks (ANN) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.The neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs.Such systems "learn" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior knowledge about cats, for example, that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying characteristics from the learning material that they process.

An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. 

# ANN in Business Intelligence
The new methodology combines genetic algorithms for choosing predictive demographic variables with artificial neural networks for developing a model of consumer response. ANN’s and GA’s have been widely used in machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis and data mining. In particular, ANN’s have been recognized as a relatively new approach in finance and marketing applications such as
stock market prediction bankruptcy prediction ,customer clustering and market segmentation.

# About this Project 

This project aims at building a Demographic Sementation model with Deep Learning Approach with the utilisation of ANN. The Dataset used for this project is a Dummy Dataset of entries of employees' in a bank and the model builds a relationship using the dependent variable to predict wheather a person stay's at the bank or leaves it.

# How You can Contribute to this Project 

Well there is nothing like contributing in this project , however if you really are interested in contributing then you may add the K-fold Cross validation technique in order to improve the efficiency of project and reduce the phenomenon of Bias-Variance Tradeoff,else feel free to fork it and it's really yours.

# Result 

Upon running the ANN with 200 epochs the accuracy obtained was 83.33456% however it kept fluctuating due to Bias-variance Tradeoff when tested with manipulated Test Set.
